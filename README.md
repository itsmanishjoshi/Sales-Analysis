# Sales Analysis - Adventure Works

### Project Overview

By analyzing various aspects of the sales data, we seek to identify trends, make data-driven decisions and gain a deeper understanding of the company's performance.




### Business Demand Letter
Steven - Sales Manager:

Hi Manish!

I hope you are doing well. We need to improve our internet sales reports and want to move from static reports to visual dashboards.
Essentially, we want to focus it on how much we have sold of what products, to which clients and how it has been over time.
Seeing as each sales person works on different products and customers it would be beneficial to be able to filter them also.
We measure our numbers against budget so I added that in a spreadsheet so we can compare our values against performance. 
The budget is for 2021 and we usually look 2 years back in time when we do analysis of sales.
Let me know if you need anything else!

-Steven

### Tools used
- SQL - Data Cleaning
- POWER BI - Creating Reports

### Data Preperation
In the initial data preperation phase, we performed the following tasks:

1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling Missing Data.
3. Data cleaning and preperation.






### Data Cleansing & Transformation (SQL)
To create the necessary data model for doing data analysis and fulfilling the business needs defined in the user stories the following tables were extracted using SQL.

One data source (sales budget) was provided in Excel format and was connected in data model in a later step of the process.

Below are some SQL statements for cleansing and transforming necessary data.


1. Cleansed FACT_InternetSales Table

``` SQL
SELECT 
  [ProductKey], 
  [OrderDateKey],
